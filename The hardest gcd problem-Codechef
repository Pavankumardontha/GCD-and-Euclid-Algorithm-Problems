        /* We will do prime factorisation for all the a[i]'s. if all the divisors in the prime factorisation 
        of a number a[i] are less than k,then we can make it 1 by dividing a[i] by all the prime factors.
        if we can make atleast one element in array a as 1,then the GCD of the whole array would be 1 which 
        is our required goal of the problem.So if for atleast one a[i], if all the divisors in the prime 
        factorization comes out to be less than K,we can make it one and the GCD of the whole array would
        be one.If there is not even one a[i] which satisfies the above property,we cannot have the GCD 
        of the whole array as 1 even after doing operations mentioned in the problem.
        Instead of finding the largest prime,in the prime factorisation of a[i], we can find the the 
        gcd of the whole array initially.Let it be g. We will find the prime factorisation of g and 
        find the largest prime in the prime factorisation of g. If this largest prime in the prime 
        factorisation of g is less than k,we can achieve our required goal. If not,we cannot achieve 
        our goal to make the GCD of the array to be 1.
        
        
        IMPORTANT POINT: 
        1)if after finding the gcd of an array and dividing each element of the array by the gcd of array,
        we will get the GCD of the new array as 1.
        2)If all of the a[i]'s have prime factor greater than k,then the gcd of a[i]'s will also have 
        a prime factor greater than k.
